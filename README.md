# whole-portfolio

This challenge was about creating a website from scratch, so I created the HTMl and CSS. The website is a professional portfolio that highlights some of my current work. It will also grow to showcase my future work. 

The top left corner consists of navigation links to three separate sections of the website: About Me, My Work, and Contact Me. 

I included a picture of myself and a description. 

The "My Work" Section provides links to current projects I have worked on as well as placeholders for future projects. Current projects are linked to GitHub repositories and will open in a new tab.

The page was adapted for multiple screen sizes.
